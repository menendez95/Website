abstract: "Why do people change their strategies for solving problems? In this
  research, we tested whether negative feedback and the context in which learners
  encounter a strategy influence their likelihood of adopting that strategy. In
  particular, we examined whether strategy adoption varied when learners were exposed
  to a target strategy in isolation, in conjunction with their own current strategy,
  and in conjunction with another novel strategy. We also investigated the roles of
  individual differences, including learners’ need for cognition and their confidence
  in their current strategies. In Study 1, undergraduate participants who encountered a
  target strategy in isolation were more likely to adopt it than participants who
  encountered it in the context of their own current strategy. Negative feedback, low
  confidence, and high need for cognition also predicted greater adoption. In Study 2,
  we examined whether rates of strategy adoption depended on the target strategy
  itself. Indeed, participants were more likely to adopt one strategy than the other,
  and the effects of feedback also varied across strategies. Individual differences—
  need for cognition and confidence— also influenced patterns of strategy adoption.
  These results suggest that strategy adoption depends on the confluence of many
  factors, including the context in which a target strategy is introduced,
  characteristics of the learner, and characteristics of the strategy itself."
