abstract: "Learning, development, and response to instruction often involve changes in
 the strategies that learners use to solve problems. In this chapter, our focus is on
 mathematical problem solving in both children and adults. We offer a selective review
 of research on three classes of factors that may influence processes of strategy
 change in mathematical problem solving: contextual factors, individual factors, and
 metacognitive factors. Contextual factors involve information that learners encounter
 in the learning context, such as feedback about prior strategies and examples of
 alternative strategies. Individual factors involve the abilities, dispositions, and
 knowledge that learners bring to the learning context. Metacognitive factors involve
 knowledge about strategies and factors that affect the application of strategies
 —including perceptions of problem difficulty, confidence in the strategies one already
 knows, and judgments about the qualities of alternative strategies. These factors
 operate both independently and in combination to influence learners’ behavior.
 Therefore, we argue that scientific progress in understanding strategy change will
 require comprehensive conceptual models that specify how different factors come
 together to explain behavior. We discuss several such models, including
 vulnerability–trigger models, cumulative risk models, and dynamic systems models.
 Research guided by such models will contribute to greater progress in understanding
 processes of strategy use and strategy change."
