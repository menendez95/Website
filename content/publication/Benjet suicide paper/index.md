abstract: "In recent years, Mexico has seen one of the largest increases in suicide
  rates worldwide, especially among adolescents and young adults. This study uses data
  from the 1,071 respondents who participated in a two-wave longitudinal study when
  they were between 12 and 17 years of age, and again when they were between 19 and 26
  years of age. The World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview
  assessed suicidal behavior and DSM-IV mental disorders. We used Cox regressions to
  evaluate which sociodemographic and psychiatric factors and life events predicted the
  incidence and remission of suicide ideation, plan, and attempt throughout the 8-year
  span. The 8-year incidence of suicide ideation, plan, and attempt was 13.3%, 4.8%,
  and 5.9%, respectively. We found that the number of traumatic life events during
  childhood, no longer being in school, and tobacco use predicted which adolescents
  developed suicide behaviors as they transitioned into young adulthood. Psychiatric
  disorders, particularly anxiety disorders, played a larger role in the persistence
  of those who already had suicidal behaviors, while behavioral disorders played a role
  in the transition from ideation to attempt. This distinction may be useful for
  clinicians to assess the risk of suicide."
