abstract: "We investigated children’s (n = 120; 3- to 11-year-olds) and adults’ (n = 18)
  reasoning about life-cycle changes in biological organisms by examining their
  endorsements of four different patterns of life-span changes. Participants were
  presented with two separate tasks: (a) judging possible adult versions of a juvenile
  animal and (b) judging possible juvenile versions of an adult animal. The stimuli
  enabled us to examine the endorsement of four different pat- terns of change:
  identical growth, natural growth, dramatic change, and speciation. The results
  suggest that endorsement of the different patterns is influenced by age and
  familiarity. Young children and individuals confronted with unfamiliar organisms
  often endorsed an identical growth that emphasizes the stability of features over
  the life span and between parents and offspring. The results are interpreted as
  supporting the idea that cognitive constraints influence individuals’ reasoning about
  biological change and that the influence of these constraints is most notable when
  individuals are young or are presented with unfamiliar biological organisms."
