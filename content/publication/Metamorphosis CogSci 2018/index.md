abstract: "Prior research on biological concepts suggests that people underestimate
  within-species variability and reject metamorphosis as a possible change for
  unfamiliar organisms. This may be due to psychological essentialism. This study
  investigated whether manipulating perceptions of biological variability (both within
  species and between species) led to increases in endorsement of metamorphosis among
  undergraduate students. We manipulated perceptions of variability by priming students
  before a lesson and by highlighting variability in the diagrams used during the
  lesson. Priming led to more endorsement of metamorphosis, but only among those with
  high prior knowledge. Our results suggest that manipulating perceptions of
  variability is not only possible but might be beneficial for those who have strong
  prior knowledge about biology."
