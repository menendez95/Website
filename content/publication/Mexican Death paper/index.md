abstract: A mixed-method approach was used to explore parent and child perspectives on
  death in Mexico. Parents’ and children’s death-related experiences and understanding
  of death were examined. While all children in this sample displayed a biological
  understanding of death, older children were less likely to endorse that all living
  things die. Children also displayed coexistence of beliefs related to death that can
  be attributed to both their biological and spiritual understanding of death. We also
  found that older children were more likely to report that a child should feel sad
  following the death of a loved one. These findings highlight how cultural practices
  shape the development of cognitive and affective processes related to death.

  death in Puebla, Mexico. While all children in this sample displayed a biological
  understanding of death, they also combined this knowledge with spiritual information.
