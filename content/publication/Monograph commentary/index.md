abstract: "Lockhart and Keil have written an interesting monograph focusing on the
  development of reasoning about medicine, a relatively underexplored area of research
  with potentially broad implications with respect to the design of more-effective
  medical interventions. In a set of 15 studies with well over 2,200 participants, they
  examine how children and adults combine aspects of biological and psychological
  reasoning to create working models of medicine. Lockhart and Keil explore
  developmental changes in reasoning about illness and its treatment using medicines in
  terms of dualism (e.g., psychological vs. physical), spatial proximity, differential
  timing of effects, potential side effects, and treatment tradeoffs. This commentary
  highlights the novel contributions of this monograph, examines issues that need
  additional considerations, and makes suggestions for future research."
