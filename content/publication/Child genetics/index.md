abstract: "Do children think of genetic inheritance as deterministic or probabilistic? In two novel tasks, children viewed the eye colors of animal parents and judged and selected possible phenotypes of offspring. Across three studies (N=353, 162 girls, 172 boys, 2 non-binary; 17 did not report gender) with predominantly White U.S. participants collected in 2019–2021, 4- to 12-year-old children showed a probabilistic understanding of genetic inheritance, and they accepted and expected variability in the genetic inheritance of eye color. Children did not show a mother bias but they did show two novel biases: perceptual similarity and sex-matching. These results held for unfamiliar animals and several physical traits (e.g., eye color, ear size, and fin type), and persisted after a lesson."

summary: We investigated children’s reasoning about genetic inheritance. 
  We found that 4- to 12-year-old children have a fairly good understanding of how genetic inheritance works, 
  but they reliably have two misunderstandings. The first one is that if the two parents 
  have the same eye color (let's say dark brown) they think that it is more likely for 
  the offspring to have a similar color (dark orange) than a different color (green). 
  The second one is that they think that if the parents have different eye colors, they
  think that female offspring are more likely to resemble the mother and male offspring 
  are more likely to resemble the father.
