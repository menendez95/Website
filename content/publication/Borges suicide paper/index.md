abstract: "Objective: To report results from a follow-up study of alcohol, cannabis and
  other drugs on suicidal behavior.
  Method: We estimated prospective associations of substance use as a risk factor for
  incident suicide ideation and attempt, from a follow-up conducted in 2013 (n 1⁄4
  1071) of the original Mexican Adolescent Mental Health Survey conducted in 2005.
  Results: Cannabis use before age 15 (ideation risk ratio (RR) 1⁄4 3.97; 95%
  confidence interval (CI) 1⁄4 1.43 e11.03; attempt RR 1⁄4 5.23; 95% CI 1⁄4
  1.17e23.32), early onset of DSM-IV drug use disorder (DUD) among cannabis users
  (ideation RR 1⁄4 3.30; 95% CI 1⁄4 1.11e9.84; attempt RR 1⁄4 4.14; 95% CI 1⁄4
  1.28e13.36), high frequency of cannabis use (RR for attempts 1⁄4 4.60; 1.03e20.60)
  and recent DSM-IV-DUD among cannabis users (RR for attempts 1⁄4 4.74; 1.09e20.57)
  increased the RR. For “other drug use”, significant results were found among those
  with high frequency use of other drugs such that they had a higher RR of suicide
  attempt (5.04; 1.03e24.64). For alcohol, only those who initiated alcohol before age
  15 had higher RRs of suicide attempt (1.79; 1.00e3.20).
  Discussion: Those who used cannabis at an early age, early onset of DSM-IV-DUD, and
  those with heavy cannabis use and recent DSM-IV-DUD among cannabis users in the last
  12-months had increased risk of suicide ideation and attempt. Drugs other than
  cannabis showed some of these associations, but to a lesser degree. Prevention of
  substance use and treatment of those already engaged in drug use, by decreasing
  suicide ideation and attempt, may help to prevent suicide in Mexico."
