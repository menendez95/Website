  Taugh weekly lab sections to 15 doctoral and master students taking an introductory statistics course, designed lessons and assements in R, and taugh a guest lecture on Bayesian data analysis. The course was an introduction to R (programming language) and inferential statistics. The focus of the course was on general and generalized linear models and linear mixed-effects models. Some special topics discussed include mediation and path analysis, moderated mediation, factor analysis, and Bayesian inferential statistics. Although the majority of the course was in-person, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I gained experience with both synchronous and asynchronous online teaching and assessment.
