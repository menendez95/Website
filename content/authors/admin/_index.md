I am a graduate student in the Department of Psychology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison working with Dr. Martha Alibali and Dr. Karl Rosengren. I am also part of the Interdisciplinary Training Programs in Education Sciences. I am an interdisciplinary scholar interested in the intersection of cognition, education, and child development. Some of my research projects have explored how children learn science concepts through conversations with parents, when and why people change the strategies they use to solve mathematics problems, and how visual representations influence learning and generalization.
